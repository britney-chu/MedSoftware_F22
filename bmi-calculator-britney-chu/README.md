## Author: Britney Chu

# Description: The user inputs their weight and height and the program does
 necessary unit conversions, calculates the BMI, then classifies
 this BMI into a category describing the fitness of the user.

# How to run the program:

To start the program navigate to the directory in which it is held and
type python3 bmi_calc.py at the command line. 

# How to use the program:

The first of two prompts will
 appear:


	Enter weight with units (kg or lb)


The user will enter their weight and include the units in their response, 
hitting enter when complete.
The second prompt will read


	Enter height with units (m or in)


The user will enter their height and include the units in their response,
hitting enter when done. The program will print to the screen the BMI
score. Then it will tell the user which classification this BMI score falls
into. 

The possible classifications are:
 * underweight
 * normal weight
